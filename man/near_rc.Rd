near_rc(lat, lon, SRS = "Google")
}
\arguments{

\item{lon}{Longitude coortinate.}

\item{SRS}{The Spatial Reference System used for the coordinates. There is a vector
with all the allowed SRSs in the variable from the package called coordinates.

The set of the available SRS to use are available in the vector `coordinates`
