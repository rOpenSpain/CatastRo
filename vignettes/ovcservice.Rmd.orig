**CatastRo** allows querying the OVCCoordenadas Web Service provided on [Sede
electrónica del
Catastro](https://ovc.catastro.meh.es/ovcservweb/ovcswlocalizacionrc/ovccoordenadas.asmx)
API directly through a **R** IDE.

This API is used to retrieve the spatial coordinates of an urban property.
Moreover, it is not necessary to be the owner to get the information; in fact, it is
enough to know the cadastral reference (*RC*) of the property and its address
(in fact, it is only completely compulsory to know the RC, however, to ensure a
good result from the response and to avoid mistakes in the RC, the address can
be passed to the query too).

Second, the API can be used to obtain a RC of an urban property. For this
purpose, the API asks for the longitude and the latitude. Furthermore, it
allows choosing the spatial reference system (SRS, also known as CRS) between a
list of them to express the coordinates.

Finally, the API tackles the issue of not knowing the exact point where the
urban property has been registered. In this case, it will return all the
properties located in a square 50-meters-side around the given point.

The documentation of this API can be found
[here](https://ovc.catastro.meh.es/ovcservweb/ovcswlocalizacionrc/ovccoordenadas.asmx).

These functions are named `catr_ovc_*` and return a `tibble`, as provided by
the package **tibble**.

## CatastRo API

The OVCCoordenadas Web Service can be reached using the following functions:

-   `catr_ovc_get_rccoor()`
-   `catr_ovc_get_rccoor_distancia()`
-   `catr_ovc_get_cpmrc()`

## Reverse Geocoding Cadastral References

The function `catr_ovc_get_rccoor()` receives the coordinates (`lat` and `lon`)
and the spatial reference system (`srs`) used to express them. It returns a
`tibble` with the cadastral reference of the property in that spatial point,
including other information such as the address (town, street, and number).

```{r}
result <- catr_ovc_get_rccoor(
  lat = 38.6196566583596,
  lon = -3.45624183836806,
  srs = "4230"
)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(result)
```

The function accepts as a `srs` argument the following values:

```{r}
data(catr_srs_values)

# OVC valid codes
library(dplyr)

catr_srs_values %>%
  filter(ovc_service == TRUE) %>%
  select(SRS, Description) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

It is also possible to get all the cadastral references in a square of
50-meters' side centered in the coordinates `lat` and `lon` through the function
`catr_ovc_get_rccoor_distancia()`.

```{r}
catr_ovc_get_rccoor_distancia(
  lat = 40.96002,
  lon = -5.663408,
  srs = "4230"
) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

## Geocoding a Cadastral Reference

The opposite query is possible as well. When given to the function
`catr_ovc_get_cpmrc()` a cadastral reference (`rc`), the province (`province`)
and the town (`municipality`), `catr_ovc_get_cpmrc()` returns its coordinates
`lat` and `lon` in a particular `srs` besides the address (town, street and
number).

```{r}
catr_ovc_get_cpmrc(
  rc = "13077A01800039",
  srs = "4230",
  province = "CIUDAD REAL",
  municipality = "SANTA CRUZ DE MUDELA"
) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

Neither the `province` nor the `municipality` is required to be passed to the
function, unless the argument `municipality` is not `NULL`, in that case the
argument `province` must be passed. If a value is passed to the
`province` argument while the `municipality` argument is `NULL`, the function
`catr_ovc_get_cpmrc()` will throw a message and will return a `tibble` with no
data.

```{r, message = TRUE}
catr_ovc_get_cpmrc(
  rc = "13077A01800039",
  municipality = "SANTA CRUZ DE MUDELA"
) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

When using only `rc` the result is provided as expected:

```{r}
# No warning, get the result
catr_ovc_get_cpmrc(rc = "13077A01800039") %>%
  knitr::kable()
```
