**CatastRo** is a package that provides access to different API services of the
[Spanish Cadastre](https://www.sedecatastro.gob.es/). With **CatastRo** you can
download spatial objects such as buildings and cadastral parcels, maps, and
geocode cadastral references.

## Installation

Install **CatastRo** from
[**CRAN**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CatastRo):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("CatastRo")
```

You can install the development version of **CatastRo** using the
[r-universe](https://ropenspain.r-universe.dev/CatastRo):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install CatastRo in R:
install.packages("CatastRo",
  repos = c(
    "https://ropenspain.r-universe.dev",
    "https://cloud.r-project.org"
  )
)
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version of **CatastRo** with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("rOpenSpain/CatastRo", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Known issues

The SSL certificate of the Spanish Cadastre presents some issues that may cause
an error when using **CatastRo** (especially on macOS, see issue
[#40](https://github.com/rOpenSpain/CatastRo/issues/40)):

```{r,eval=FALSE}
#> ...(more lines on error)
#>
#> 1: In download.file(url, filepath, quiet = isFALSE(verbose), mode = "wb") :
#>   URL 'https://www.catastro.minhafp.es/INSPIRE/Addresses/ES.SDGC.AD.atom.xml':
#>   status was 'SSL peer certificate or SSH remote key was not OK'
#>
#> ...
```

You can try to fix it by running this line on your session right after you start
using the package:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
options(download.file.method = "curl", download.file.extra = "-k -L")
```

## Package API

The functions of **CatastRo** are organized by API endpoint. The package naming
convention is `catr_*api*_*description*`.

### OVCCoordenadas

These functions allow geocoding and reverse geocoding of cadastral references
using the
[OVCCoordenadas](https://ovc.catastro.meh.es/ovcservweb/OVCSWLocalizacionRC/OVCCoordenadas.asmx)
service.

These functions are named `catr_ovc_get_*` and return a tibble, as provided by
the package **tibble**. See `vignette("ovcservice", package = "CatastRo")` where
these functions are described.

### INSPIRE

These functions return spatial objects in the formats provided by the **sf** or
**terra** packages using the [Catastro
INSPIRE](https://www.catastro.hacienda.gob.es/webinspire/index.html) service.

Note that the coverage of this service is 95% of the Spanish territory,
[excluding the Basque Country and Navarre]{.underline}[^1] that have their own
independent cadastral offices.

[^1]: The package [**CatastRoNav**](https://ropenspain.github.io/CatastRoNav/)
    provides access to the Cadastre of Navarre, with similar functionalities to
    **CatastRo**.

There are three types of functions, each one querying a different service:

#### ATOM service

The ATOM service allows batch-downloading vector objects of different cadastral
elements for a specific municipality. The result is provided as `sf` objects
(See **sf** package).

These functions are named `catr_atom_get_xxx`.

#### WFS service

The WFS service allows downloading vector objects of specific cadastral
elements. The result is provided as `sf` class objects (see
[**sf**](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) package). Note that there are some
limitations on the extent and number of elements to query. For batch-downloading
the ATOM service is preferred.

These functions are named `catr_wms_get_xxx`.

#### WMS service

This service allows downloading georeferenced images of different cadastral
elements. The result is a raster in the format provided by
[**terra**](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/terra-package.html).

There is a single function for querying this service: `catr_wms_get_layer()`.

#### Terms and conditions of use

Please check the [downloading
provisions](https://www.catastro.hacienda.gob.es/webinspire/documentos/Licencia.pdf)
of the service.

## Examples

This script highlights some features of **CatastRo**:

### Geocode a cadastral reference

```{r}
library(CatastRo)

catr_ovc_get_cpmrc(rc = "13077A01800039")
```

### Extract a cadastral reference from a given set of coordinates

```{r}
catr_ovc_get_rccoor(
  lat = 38.6196566583596,
  lon = -3.45624183836806,
  srs = "4230"
)
```

### Extract geometries using the ATOM service

```{r atom, fig.alt="Extracting buildings in Nava de la Asuncion with the ATOM service"}
bu <- catr_atom_get_buildings("Nava de la Asuncion", to = "Segovia")


# Map
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(bu) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = currentUse), col = NA) +
  coord_sf(
    xlim = c(374500, 375500),
    ylim = c(4556500, 4557500)
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = hcl.colors(6, "Dark 3")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Nava de la Asunción, Segovia")
```

### Extract geometries using the WFS service

```{r wfs, fig.alt="Extract Leon Cathedral with the WFS service"}
wfs_get_buildings <- catr_wfs_get_buildings_bbox(
  c(-5.569, 42.598, -5.564, 42.601),
  srs = 4326
)

# Map
ggplot(wfs_get_buildings) +
  geom_sf() +
  ggtitle("Leon Cathedral, Spain")
```

## A note on caching

Some datasets and tiles may have a size larger than 50MB. You can use
**CatastRo** to create your own local repository at a given local directory
passing the following option:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
catr_set_cache_dir("./path/to/location")
```

When this option is set, **CatastRo** will look for the cached file and it will
load it, speeding up the process.

## Citation

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
print(citation("CatastRo"), style = "html")
```

A BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is:

```{r echo=FALSE, comment=''}
toBibtex(citation("CatastRo"))
```
